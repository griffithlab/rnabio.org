Dr. Malachi Griffith is an Assistant Director of the McDonnell Genome Institute and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine. Dr. Griffith's research is focused on the development of genomics, bioinformatics and statistical methods as they apply to the study of cancer biology and medicine. A particular focus of his work is in the translation of genomics data from whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing into clinically actionable observations and personalized cancer therapies.
 Dr. Griffith is a regular instructor for the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops series and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. Dr. Griffith is currently supported by an NIH R00 pathway to independence grant. Before coming to Washington University, Dr. Griffith was a bioinformatics post-doctoral fellow at the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences center in Vancouver, British Columbia. He received his Ph.D. (Medical Genetics, 2009) from the University of British Columbia and B.S. (Biochemistry and Biology with Honors, 2002) from the University of Winnipeg.

Kelsy is a PhD candidate in the Molecular Cell Biology program at Washington University in St. Louis. She completed her undergraduate degree at Mercer University in 2016, where she earned a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She is interested in developing methods to analyze multiple types of sequencing data in order to better understand regulatory mutations and splicing within cancer, particularly with respect to personalized cancer vaccine design. Currently, she is involved with <a href="http://dgidb.org">DGIdb</a>, <a href="http://regtools.org">RegTools</a>, ORegAnno and analysis of several breast cancer clinical cohorts. She is also part of the Precision Medicine Pathway and Cancer Biology Pathway at WashU, which allows to better understand how she can translate genomics and informatics into the clinic more efficiently.
