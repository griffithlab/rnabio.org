Use the GAGE tool in R to test for significantly enriched sets of genes within those genes found to be "up" and "down" in our HBR vs UHR differential gene expression analysis. Do we see enrichment for genes associated with brain related cell types and processes in the list of DE genes that are significantly higher expression in the HBR samples compared to the UHR samples?
