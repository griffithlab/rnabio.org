In this tutorial, created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ([alembic theme](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic)) and [Kramdown Flavored Markdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/), code blocks display commands necessary to complete the tutorial. Some sections are marked as optional and can be skipped.

A code block will look like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install tree
cd ~
# comment
tree -I workspace/tools 
```

All lines contained within the highlighted boxes will need to be executed at the linux command line or an R command prompt (be careful to follow which you should be using). When copy/paste is used, be sure to hit Return or Enter after pasting each command or set of commands. All lines starting with a '#' are comments and will not be interpretted by the shell/R session.
