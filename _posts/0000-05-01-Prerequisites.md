## Do these before coming to the workshop:

### 1.) Command line tutorial
You are expected to be familiar with basic command line usage before the workshop. If you are unfamiliar with **the command line**, below is a suggested tutorial. If you have a Mac computer you can use the "Terminal" application to complete this tutorial. If you have access to a linux server at your institution you could do it there. If neither of those is available you can try a free online termline application that runs in your browser such as [sandbox.io](https://sandbox.bio/playground) or [COCALC](https://cocalc.com/app?anonymous=terminal).

* [Unix cheat sheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)

### 2.) Reading materials
Please read these articles before coming to the workshop:

* RNA-seq data fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing: The Teenage Years](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31341269/).
* RNA-seq analysis and statistics fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing Data: Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Expression Analysis](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-072018-021255).
* scRNA-seq technologies and applications. [Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and applications: A brief overview](https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.694)
* DNA sequencing and variant calling overview [Novel sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools for deciphering the non-coding genome](https://doi.org/10.1515/medgen-2021-2072)

Optional readings:

These are just three recently published examples that we find particularly good. We have collected a much more extensive list of resources that should be aware of below. Simply take a look at these and note for future reference.
