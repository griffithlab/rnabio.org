## Do these before coming to the workshop:

### 1.) Command line tutorial
You are expected to be familiar with basic command line usage before the workshop. If you are unfamiliar with **the command line**, below are some suggested tutorials. If you have a Mac computer you can use the "Terminal" application to complete these tutorials. If you have access to a linux server at your institution you could also do them there. If neither of those is available you can try a free online terminal application that runs in your browser such as [sandbox.io](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials/playground) (also includes several relevant tutorials). Work through at least some of the below options.

* [Unix Intro Tutorial](https://rnabio.org/module-00-setup/0000/08/01/Unix/)
* [Unix cheat sheet](https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html)
* [More tutorials from BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/p/9572411/)

### 2.) Introduction to R tutorial
Knowing R is critical to this workshop. Using R installed on your computer, please work through at least some of the following tutorials.

* [R Tutorial (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/r/default.asp)
* [Introduction to R (datacamp)](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (Take first free chapter)
* [R Review & Assessment](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/r-review-and-assessment/r-review-and-assessment.html)
* [GenViz Intro R tutorial](https://genviz.org/module-02-r/0002/02/01/introductionToR/) (Note this tutorial is more advanced, especially the final exerxise, and not required)

### 3.) Reading materials
Please read these articles before coming to the workshop:

* RNA-seq data fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing: The Teenage Years](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31341269/).
* RNA-seq analysis and statistics fundamentals. [RNA Sequencing Data: Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Expression Analysis](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-072018-021255).
* RNA-seq analysis for tumor immunity. [Tutorial: integrative computational analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data to characterize tumor immunity using RIMA](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-023-00841-8).
* scRNA-seq technologies and applications. [Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and applications: A brief overview](https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.694).
* DNA sequencing and variant calling overview [Novel sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools for deciphering the non-coding genome](https://doi.org/10.1515/medgen-2021-2072).

Optional readings:

The above are just a few published examples that we find particularly good. We have collected a much more extensive list of resources below. Simply take a look at these and note for future reference. Note, these are focused primary towards RNAseq analysis but are often more generally applicable.
