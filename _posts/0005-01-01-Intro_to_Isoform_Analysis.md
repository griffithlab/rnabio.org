### Module 5 - Key concepts
* alternative expression, splicing, differential splicing analysis

### Module 5 - Learning objectives
* Use StringTie in modes that facilitate transcript/isoform discovery
* Use Cuffmerge to combine transcriptomes from multiple StringTie runs and compare assembled transcripts to known transcripts
* Learn how to perform differential splicing analysis with Ballgown
* Examine junctions counts with RegTools and StringTie alternative transcript files at the command line
* Visualize junction counts and StringTie assembled transcripts in IGV
