The goal of the following team assignment is for students to gain hands-on experience by working on recently published RNA-seq data and apply the concepts they have learned up regarding expression estimation and differential expression analysis. To complete this assignment, students will need to review commands we performed in earlier sections.


## PART 3: Expression Estimation

**Goals:**

- Familiarize yourself with Stringtie options
- Run Stringtie to obtain expression values
- Obtain expression values for the gene SOX4
- Create an expression results directory, run Stringtie on all samples, and store the results in appropriately named subdirectories in this results dir
